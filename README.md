# diy-graphics-engine
A DIY 3D graphics engine made in Rust for the purpose of learning about rendering, graphics programming, and common graphics libraries/specs. 

Based mostly off of the following tutorial series:
- [Code-It-Yorself! 3D Graphics Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU)
- [Rust and OpenGL from scratch](https://nercury.github.io/rust/opengl/tutorial/2018/02/08/opengl-in-rust-from-scratch-00-setup.html)
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
